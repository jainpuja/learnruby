Data types in basic ruby are 3:- 
number/Integer - any number, 
Boolean - true/false, 
String - text writeen in "text".

Variable assigning is creating a variable name and storing a value in it,
eg. my_numbaer = 3, my_name = "Puja Pritesh Jain", 
is_male = true...in case of boolean true/false will written directly same as number 
& not in"true" here it will read as string.

Codes for performing basic math's calculations using operators:-

num1 = 4
num2 = 7
puts num1 + num2 - Addition
puts num1 - num2 - Subraction
puts num1 * num2 - Multiply
puts num1 / num2 - Division
puts num1 ** num2 - Exponentional is raise to ie. 4*4 7 times
puts num1 % num2 - Modulo....????? is the remainder

Allternative method / code is 
sum = 13 + 379
product = 923 * 15
quotient = 13209 / 17
puts sum
puts product
puts quotient

Print/puts is used to print a output on screen, 
in print all output will come in same line 
but in case of put a new line will be inserted & output will be on diff lines.
puts = print string
If first print is used & then 2 puts is used then 1 puts will be printed on same line
where print is used & other puts on diff line.
puts automatically goes to next line & print output,ie. output on diff lines.

String Mehtods:- puts "String".string method
1. .length = count length of the string including letters, numbers, spaces & symbols.  
2. .reverse = backward version of string
3. .upcase = everything in capital 
4. .downcase = everything in lowwer case
5. .capitalize = first letter is capital & remaining are small.
In all the above method if ! is placed then it will change everytime,
else it will be only one time.
6. .strip = deletes extra before & after spaces
7. .chomp = deletes extra line

In ruby for better understanding of code, comments play a very important role.
One line Comments can be added by using # key & space & 
then write comment.(Short cut key = command + Slash/ key)
Multiple line comments can be written by using -
=begin enter comment enter =end.

If you want any information or data from user or console then
gets is used.
In ruby after gets an extra line is inserted automatically 
so we need to delete the line by using .chomp

String interpolation & cocat - meaning & all

If you want data in different line in one puts statement,
/n can be used.
