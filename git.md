2. git add file_name = Use this command on files which are to be added in git.
3. git commit -m " Write the purpose of file or code changes in this comment " = This saves the file changes to local git.
4. git push origin master = Push the current local git changes to github, taking from local git to github.
5. git pull origin master = Pull the latest changes from github to git local, extracting from github to gitlocal.

git pull & push allows to sync the code between them ie. between local git & github git, eg.Group exps 
git is a software or a technology, github uses git & gives us a free space to store the files...
practise pull requests
commit is the changes which you make in git
The above order shall be followed everytime when we make changes in files ie. local git.
Everytime before push local master should have all the changes of github master & then only push can be sucessfully used, otherwise it will fail with msg "fetch first"
push 
pull request only if there is any changes in branch & not masters.
